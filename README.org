A framework for taking notes with Org-mode, in multiple files and multiple folders, under one main folder.

* Notes

- Diary entries are saved on each individual files, and a reference copy is placed in a central file DIARY from which the agenda is created.
- TODO entires are entered in the diary file only, with a link to the file of the project to which they belong.  A command will be defined to refile entries marked as DONE to the project files to which they belong. 

* El-get recipe:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(:name org-pm :url "http://github.com/iani/org-notes.git" :type git :features
       (org-pm)
       :after nil)
#+END_SRC
