A framework for taking notes with Org-mode, in multiple files and multiple folders, under one main folder.

Developed in November 2014, tested with 6 months intense use.

Originally included in my emacs init-file.  Here saved as separate library.

El-get recipe:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(:name org-pm :url "http://github.com/iani/org-notes.git" :type git :features
       (org-pm)
       :after nil)
#+END_SRC
